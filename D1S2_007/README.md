`7_jazz-march_88_beat_4-4.mid`

This performance,  in the style of a march (drum), 
contains a lots of drags (3 grace-note + 1 note on SD)

this kind of ornament is not currently supported by the parser, hence many mistakes.



- add an option for drags (3 or 5) 
  for a detection during tokenization
